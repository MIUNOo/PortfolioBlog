Hello, my name is *Chenjie Zhang*. I'm a new post-graduate student at the *University of Southern California*, starting in the fall of 2024, majoring in *Computer Science - Game Development*. I have experience with *Unity* and *Unreal Engine*, and I have built several projects using these platforms.

When participating in game jams, I like to use the code name *“MIUNO”*. This name, pronounced */muno/*, is inspired by the code name *MONA* from *Persona 5*.

<!-- My experience in game development originated from my childhood(OLD STORY), I like playing video games just like other kids. Years past, I found myself obssestion with doing software things, I made a hobby of dealing with some professional softwares though I known little things about them at that time. The obssesion triggered my unlocking a new skill of making videos, explicitly, promotion videos for music. I made a few PV just for fun and gradually made up my mind to give a try in making video games when I grow up. And now, with a long goal I finally got some skills in developing games. I'm currently learning computer graphics and way to develop a small game engine with c++.  -->


My experience in game development originated from my childhood. (OLD STORY) Like many other kids, I enjoyed playing video games. As the years passed, I found myself obsessed with computer software. I made a hobby of exploring professional software, even though I knew very little about them at the time. This obsession led me to discover a new skill: creating promotional videos for music. I made a few PVs just for fun and gradually decided to try making video games when I grew up.

Now, with a long-term goal in mind, I have finally acquired some skills in game development. I'm currently learning computer graphics and how to develop a small game engine using C++.

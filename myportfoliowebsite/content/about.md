Hello, my name is *Chenjie Zhang*. I am a new post-graduate student at the *University of Southern California*, starting in the fall of 2024, majoring in *Computer Science - Game Development*. I have experience with *Unity* and *Unreal Engine*, and I have built several projects using these platforms.

When participating in game jams, I like to use the code name *“MIUNO”*. This name, pronounced */muno/*, is inspired by the code name *MONA* from *Persona 5*.

Hello, my name is *Chenjie Zhang*. I'm a graduate student at the *University of Southern California*, starting in the fall of 2024, majoring in *Computer Science - Game Development*. I have experience with *Unity* and *Unreal Engine*, and I have built several projects using these game engines.

When participating in game jams, I like to use the code name *“MIUNO”*. This name, pronounced *[ˈmjuːno]*, is inspired by the code name *MONA* from *Persona 5*.

<!-- My experience in game development originated from my childhood(OLD STORY), I like playing video games just like other kids. Years past, I found myself obssestion with doing software things, I made a hobby of dealing with some professional softwares though I known little things about them at that time. The obssesion triggered my unlocking a new skill of making videos, explicitly, promotion videos for music. I made a few PV just for fun and gradually made up my mind to give a try in making video games when I grow up. And now, with a long goal I finally got some skills in developing games. I'm currently learning computer graphics and way to develop a small game engine with c++.  -->


My experience in game development originated from my childhood. (OLD STORY) Like many other kids, I enjoyed playing video games. As the years passed, I found myself obsessed with computer softwares. I made a hobby of exploring professional software and making small stuffs, even though I knew very little about them at the time. This obsession led me to discover a new skill: creating promotional videos(PV) for music. I made a few PVs just for practices and gradually decided to try making video games when I grew up.

<!-- I believe game development and software development could be very customized in the near future, one can develop for his own needs and the learning process won't be hard and long. Which means people's ideas could become reality and ready-for-use in a short time. I would like to spread my ideas to the world and also build a world that help others to share thoughts. -->

I believe game development and software development could be very customized in the near future. One can develop for their own needs, and the learning process won't be hard and long. This means people's ideas could become reality and ready for use in a short time. I would like to spread my ideas to the world and also build a world that helps others to share their thoughts.

Now, with a long-term goal in mind, I have finally acquired some skills in game development. I'm currently learning computer graphics and how to develop a small game engine using C++.
